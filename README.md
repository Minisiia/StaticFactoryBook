## StaticFactoryBook
## Design patterns. Static Factory
You need to create a Book class, which represents a book with a title, author, and year of publication. To create an instance of the Book class, you should use a static factory called BookFactory, which will have the following methods:

1. createBookWithTitle(String title, String author) - creates a book with the given title and author, the year of publication will be set to the current year.
2. createBookWithTitleAndYear(String title, String author, int year) - creates a book with the given title, author, and year of publication.
